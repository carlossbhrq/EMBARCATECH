# Embarcatech - Raspberry Pi Pico W with BitDogLab

This repository contains the tasks and projects developed in the **Embarcatech** course, where we explore the use of the **Raspberry Pi Pico W** microcontroller together with the **BitDogLab** board. The course focuses on embedded systems programmed in the **C** language. 

## About the Course

The Embarcatech course teaches the fundamentals and techniques for developing embedded software using the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the BitDogLab board. Throughout the lessons, we learn to control peripherals, perform simulations, and program real-world projects using the C language.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into directories representing different tasks and projects from the course. Each directory contains:

- **Source code**: C implementations for exercises and projects.
